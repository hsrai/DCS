## Architect

The first recorded use of the word "architect" in English dates to 1563.

In ancient Greece and Rome, the term was used for master builders or chief designers of important works, but in English and Western Europe, it reappeared and gained popularity during the Renaissance as classical texts were rediscovered.

Originally, the word emphasized the role of a "master builder" or leader in construction, not just the designer, and only with time did it come to mean a professional focused mainly on planning and design.

The Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) is established in 1834 as a body for the architectural profession. The American Institute of Architects (AIA) was founded in 1857. In India, the Indian Institute of Architects (IIA) was established in 1917 and formally registered in 1929. It is the national body of architects in India, analogous to civil engineering institutions.

## Engineer

The term "engineer," dates back to the 14th century. An "engineer" was someone who built or operated military engines (mechanical contraptions used in war, like catapults). The root "engine" comes from the Latin ingenium (around 1250), meaning "innate quality" or "clever invention".

The term civil engineering emerged in the 18th century to distinguish work related to civilian projects such as roads, bridges, and buildings from military engineering. The first person to call himself a "civil engineer" was the Englishman John Smeaton in 1761. This usage became more formalized with the establishment of societies and schools dedicated to civil engineering, such as the École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées in France (1747) and the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers in Britain (1771). The Institution of Civil Engineers in London was founded in 1818 and received a Royal Charter in 1828, formally recognizing civil engineering as a profession.
