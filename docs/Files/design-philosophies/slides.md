## Introduction

Civil engineering is the art and science of designing and building structures such as houses, bridges, dams, and skyscrapers. Our design methods, however, have not always been as advanced as they are today. Over centuries, engineers have learned from both successes and failures, while gradually applying mathematics to improve safety and efficiency.

The evolution of design philosophies reflects humanity’s growing understanding of strength, safety, and uncertainty in construction. Each new philosophy was introduced to address the shortcomings of the current one. With every step, the role of mathematics became more sophisticated, moving from simple empirical rules to probability-based models.

Historical development of design methods, the growing involvement of mathematics, and their adoption in international standards as well as Indian codes are presented below.

## 1. Empirical Design (Before 1900s)

- **Vishwakarma** is considered as the god of engineers, architects, and craftsmen. He is the architect and chief engineer of the gods, credited with constructing their heavenly abodes, celestial weapons, and chariots.  
  - In Satya Yuga, he built Swarg Loka (heaven).  
  - In Treta Yuga, he built 'Sone ki Lanka' (Golden Lanka).  
  - In Dwapar Yuga, he built Dwarka (Krishna's city).  
  - In Kali Yuga, he constructed Indraprastha (Pandavas’ capital).

In the early stages of engineering, structures were designed based on experience and rules of thumb. Builders used proportions observed from successful structures like arches, bridges, and cathedrals. Mathematics was minimal, usually limited to geometry and simple arithmetic.

**Limitation:** While useful for traditional materials such as stone and timber, empirical design could not ensure safety for modern materials like steel and reinforced concrete.

#### 1.1 Ancient Era (before 1600 AD) – Rule of Thumb and Experience

Builders relied mostly on experience and tradition. The Egyptians built the pyramids (around 2500 BC), the Romans built aqueducts and the Colosseum (around 100 AD). Structures were massive and heavy.

#### 1.2 1600–1800 – Beginning of Scientific Approach

![Galileo Galilei]([https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Justus_Sustermans_-_Portrait_of_Galileo_Galilei_%28Uffizi%29.jpg/500px-Justus_Sustermans_-_Portrait_of_Galileo_Galilei_%28Uffizi%29.jpg))

The Renaissance initiated interest in science and mathematics. Galileo (1638) studied the strength of beams. Robert Hooke (1678) discovered the law of elasticity ("Hooke’s Law": extension is proportional to force). Engineers began to understand how loads and forces act on materials.

#### 1.3 1800–1900 – Elastic Theory and Factor of Safety

![Tay Bridge Disaster]([https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Tay_bridge_disaster.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Catastrophe_du_pont_sur_le_Tay_-_1879_-_Illustration.jpg/960px-Catastrophe_du_pont_sur_le_Tay_-_1879_-_Illustration.jpg)

Industrial Revolution: bridges, railways, factories. Many new materials like steel were used, but also many failures occurred. Example: The Tay Bridge Disaster (Scotland, 1879) collapsed in a storm, killing 75 people. To avoid failures, engineers introduced the idea of a Factor of Safety (FoS).

## 2. Working Stress Method (WSM)

### Timeline

- Internationally: Early 1900s to 1960s  
- India: IS 456:1953 (First RC code), IS 800:1956 (First steel code)

### Key Ideas

WSM assumes that both material stress and structural response remain within the elastic range. Safety is ensured by applying a factor of safety (FoS) to the yield or ultimate strength.

**Mathematics:** Linear elastic theory, simple stress–strain relations, service load analysis.

**Advantages over Empirical Design:**
- Rational basis using Hooke’s law
- Simple mathematics, easy to apply
- Predictable service behavior (deflection, cracking, etc.)

---

## 3. Ultimate Load Method (ULM)

WSM often gave uneconomical sections because the FoS was uniform and did not reflect different uncertainties in loads and material strengths.

### Timeline of ULM

- Internationally: 1950s–1970s  
- India: IS 456:1964 (alternative), IS 456:1978 (main method), IS 800:1984 (steel)

### Key Ideas

ULM was introduced to achieve more economical designs. Instead of service loads, factored (increased) loads were considered and compared against the ultimate capacity of the member.

**Mathematics:** Nonlinear stress–strain curves, plastic theory, ultimate strength analysis.

**Advantages over WSM:**
- More economical use of material
- Reflected the actual failure strength of structures

---

## 4. Limit State Method (LSM)

### Limitation of ULM

ULM focused only on collapse safety and ignored serviceability aspects such as deflection and cracking.

### Timeline of LSM

- Internationally: Since 1970s (Eurocodes, ACI, etc.)  
- India: IS 456:1978 (option), IS 456:2000 (main method), IS 800:2007 (steel)

### Key Ideas

LSM combines the strengths of WSM and ULM. It introduces different categories of limit states:
1. Ultimate Limit States (safety against collapse)
2. Serviceability Limit States (deflection, vibration, cracking, durability)

Loads and material strengths are treated with different partial safety factors.

**Mathematics:** Indirect use of probability, statistical calibration of load and resistance factors.

**Advantages over ULM:**
- Balanced safety and serviceability
- More realistic treatment of loads and materials
- Adopted worldwide and still dominant today

## 5. Reliability-Based and Probability-Based Design

![Probability and Safety]([https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Normal_Distribution_PDF.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Probabilistic_Design_Distributions.svg/1024px-Probabilistic_Design_Distributions.svg.png))

### Limitation of LSM

Partial safety factors are semi-probabilistic, based on judgment and calibration. They do not fully reflect probability of failure.

### Timeline

- Internationally: Research since 1970s, ISO 2394 (1998/revised 2015)
- Eurocode EN 1990 (Basis of Structural Design, 2002) explicitly uses reliability principles
- USA: AISC and ACI codes calibrate safety factors by reliability analysis
- India: IS 16700:2017 refers to reliability/performance, but full probability design not common yet

### Key Ideas

Probability theory is used to directly quantify the safety level. Instead of fixed safety factors, the design ensures a target reliability index (β), which corresponds to a very small probability of failure (Pf).

**Mathematics:** Advanced statistics, probability distributions, reliability index, Monte Carlo simulation, stochastic models.

**Advantages over LSM:**
- Rational treatment of uncertainties
- Target safety levels can vary by structure
- Scientific link between mathematics and safety philosophy

## Research Trend

- Reliability-based design is actively researched in structural, offshore, earthquake, and risk engineering.
- Computer power makes probability methods practical.
- Many countries are integrating these into codes, though LSM with reliability calibration remains dominant.

## Conclusion

The evolution of design philosophies shows a gradual shift:

- From empirical (experience-based)
- To deterministic (WSM and ULM)
- To semi-probabilistic (LSM)
- To fully probabilistic (Reliability-based design)

Each step added deeper mathematical sophistication: from simple elastic theory, to nonlinear plastic theory, to probability and statistics. Codes and standards reflect this progression, with research now pointing to full reliability-based methods for the future.
